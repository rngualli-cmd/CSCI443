However, due to variability in the process, the lengths of the rods follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 100 cm and a standard deviation of 2 cm. What is the probability that a randomly selected steel rod from this process will be either shorter than 96 cm or longer than 104 cm? Use the error function (erf) to compute this probability.
